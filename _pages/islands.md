## Shetland
Shetland forms one of Scotland's 32 council areas and one of its three islands councils. Shetland shares a UK parliamentary constituency with Orkney and elects its own member to the devolved Scottish Parliament. The Shetland Islands Council is comprised of 23 councillors elected from seven wards using Single Transferable Vote.  Shetland is notable both for the dominance of the Liberal Democrats at the national level, who have won every parliamentary election since 1950, and for its largely non-partisan local politics. The next Shetland Islands Council election is scheduled for 6 May 2027.

## [Åland](/islands/aland/)
Åland is a self-governing and autonomous Swedish-speaking island territory of Finland. The Åland islands elect a singular guaranteed Member of Parliament to Finnish 200-strong Parliament Eduskunta, on top of which they have self-governing 30-member parliament *Lagting*. Åland has a multi-party system in place and elects its 30 members to Lagting with proportional D'Hondt method every four years. Next elections are scheduled for 15 October 2023.
